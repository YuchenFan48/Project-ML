# Project-ML: Facial Expression Analysis with Deep Learning

## Overview
"Project-ML" is a comprehensive machine learning research project focused on facial expression analysis. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the project aims to classify facial expressions and detect head poses from images.

## Brief Description

- `CBU5201_miniproject_basic.ipynb`: Basic machine learning approaches for classification and regression in facial expression and head pose detection.
- `CBU5201_miniproject_advanced.ipynb`: Advanced machine learning techniques for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning in facial expression classification.
- `genki4k.tar`: Dataset file containing images used for training and testing models.
- `README.md`: Detailed documentation and guidelines for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.
- `resnet-classification.pth`: Fine-Tuned ResNet model weights for classification tasks.
- `resnet-Detection.pth`: Fine-Tuned ResNet model weights for detection tasks.
- `resnet18-classification.pth`: Alternative ResNet18 model weights for classification.
- `resnet18-Detection.pth`: Alternative ResNet18 model weights for detection.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch 2.0
- OpenCV
- Other libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
Install the required libraries using:
```
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

## Usage
- Use the Jupyter notebooks to experiment with different machine learning models.
- The `.pth` files contain pre-trained models which can be loaded for prediction or further training.
- *Feel free to experiment with other models you need in the Model Block in the .ipynb file*
